# Navigation Helper

This is actually mostluy a test to see if I'll use this myself. I always write my navigations from scratch because they're never
really identical to the previous one I wrote.

`_NavigationHelper.xslt` was extracted from various navigations I've built (the reusable parts, anyway) and intended to use as an include for your own.
