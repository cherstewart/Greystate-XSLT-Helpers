# Navigation Helper

<<<<<<< HEAD
Building navigations is a great way to learn the intricacies of XSLT and XPath (I've almost always built them from
scratch, no matter which system I was using). Yes, they're usually very similar to each other and yet, there seem to
always be a single little difference that requires you to change something or swap stuff around.

This is why most of the "Generic Navigation" scripts you'll encounter grow to be pretty large "libraries" with a myriad of settings,

This is actually mostluy a test to see if I'll use this myself. I always write my navigations from scratch because they're never
really identical to the previous one I wrote.

`_NavigationHelper.xslt` was extracted from various navigations I've built (the reusable parts, anyway) and intended to use as an include for your own.
