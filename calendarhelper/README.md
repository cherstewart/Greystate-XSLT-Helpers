# Calendar Helper

This helper will generate a calendar for any given month and you can have it automatically apply your
custom templates to events (XML nodes with a datetime attribute/property) that occur on dates in that
month.

It's fully localizable and you don't have to put up with the "but Sunday *is* the first day of the week"
from various others :-)
