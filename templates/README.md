The package installs these as templates available in Umbraco, when you create a new XSLT file (+ macro).

They're all prefixed with the string "Use" to group them in the dialog.

## Use Calendar Helper

A simple macro to get you going with the **Calendar Helper.** Creates a calendar of updates to your Umbraco nodes, using `@updateDate` as the "event date".
