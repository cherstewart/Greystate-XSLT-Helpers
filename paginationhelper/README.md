# Pagination Helper

You&#8217;ve probably been doing pagination more than once in your life as a developer; and most likely in
more than one language, right? Yeah, so have I &#8212; and every time I&#8217;ve said to myself: "Why can&#8217;t
I just include some kind of file that does this and be done with it already?".
So I finally went and built a general purpose, easily modifiable way to paginate stuff with XSLT, and I couldn&#8217;t
think of a single reason why it shouldn&#8217;t be available to you too, so here it is. 

This was developed while using the excellent [Umbraco CMS](http://umbraco.com) but I have extracted the generic bits so
it should be usable as a drop-in solution whenever you&#8217;re doing XSLT and suddenly get that "Oh, I guess I&#8217;ll need
to paginate this set..." feeling.

## How to use it

There&#8217;s very little work involved in using the Pagination Helper, basically you do three things:

* Include `_PaginationHelper.xslt` in your main XSLT file (e.g. an Umbraco macro XSLT file)

```xslt
<xsl:include href="_PaginationHelper.xslt" />
```

* Create a *template* for a single item to be rendered (e.g. a search result or a thumbnail image)

```xslt
<xsl:template match="Textpage">
	<li>
		<a href="{umbraco.library:NiceUrl(@id)}">
			<img src="{pageImageThumbnail}" width="100" height="80" alt="{@nodeName}" />
		</a>
	</li>
</xsl:template>
```

* Call the `PaginateSelection` template where you want the paged result to appear 

```xslt
<xsl:template match="/">
	<xsl:call-template name="PaginateSelection">
		<xsl:with-param name="selection" select="$currentPage/Textpage" />
	</xsl:call-template>
</xsl:template>
```

Simple, huh?

## Details

By default, the `PaginateSelection` template will paginate the children of the context node when called, but you can
specify the exact selection of nodes to paginate by supplying the parameter `selection` when calling the template.
(So, in Umbraco, we&#8217;ll use `$currentPage` for context as long as we&#8217;re inside the *root* template.

If for some reason you need to render the *pager controls* in a specific place and not as part of the automatic
output, you can turn them off with the `showPager` parameter by supplying `false()` or `0` (zero). Then you
can manually output the controls by calling `RenderPager`, using the same `selection` parameter as you called the
`PaginateSelection` template with, to get the paging controls where you want them.

## QueryString options

The pager links rendered will include all existing querystring options on the original page (i.e., "page 1"), so if
that page was the result of a search, e.g.: `?search=pagination+in+xslt`, the page parameter will just be tacked on to that
so everything works as expected.

## Customization

The actual pagination is done with a *QueryString* parameter named `p`, which can be changed if you need to - it&#8217;s
defined in the *variable* `pagerParam` right at the top of the file. Here you can also change the wording of the
*Previous* and *Next* links generated, and the number of results per page (default is 10). You can even change the function that
retrieves the options for the current page, which defaults to the server variable `QUERY_STRING`
(using `umbraco.library:RequestServerVariables()`)  but if you&#8217;re not using this with Umbraco you&#8217;re bound to
get that from some other extension function. It assumes the standard query string `key=value&otherkey=othervalue` format.

Also, there's a variable to hold the current page's URL - again, you can set it any way you like; the default uses Umbraco's
`NiceUrl()` extension.
